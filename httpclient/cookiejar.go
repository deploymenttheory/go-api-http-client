/* When both the cookie jar is enabled and specific cookies are set for an HTTP client in
your scenario, hereâ€™s what generally happens during the request processing:

Cookie Jar Initialization: If the cookie jar is enabled through your SetupCookieJar function,
an instance of http.cookiejar.Jar is created and associated with your HTTP client. This
cookie jar will automatically handle incoming and outgoing cookies for all requests made
using this client. It manages storing cookies and automatically sending them with subsequent
requests to the domains for which they're valid.

Setting Specific Cookies: The ApplyCustomCookies function checks for any user-defined specific
cookies (from the CustomCookies map). If found, these cookies are explicitly added to the
outgoing HTTP request headers via the SetSpecificCookies function.

Interaction between Cookie Jar and Specific Cookies:
Cookie Precedence: When a specific cookie (added via SetSpecificCookies) shares the same name
as a cookie already handled by the cookie jar for a given domain, the behavior depends on the
implementation of the HTTP client's cookie handling and the server's cookie management rules.
Generally, the explicitly set cookie in the HTTP request header (from SetSpecificCookies)
should override any similar cookie managed by the cookie jar for that single request.

Subsequent Requests: For subsequent requests, if the specific cookies are not added again
via ApplyCustomCookies, the cookies in the jar that were stored from previous responses
will take precedence again, unless overwritten by subsequent responses or explicit setting
again.

Practical Usage:

This setup allows flexibility:

Use Cookie Jar: For general session management where cookies are automatically managed across
requests.
Use Specific Cookies: For overriding or adding specific cookies for particular requests where
customized control is necessary (such as testing scenarios, special authentication cookies,
etc.).
Logging and Debugging: Your setup also includes logging functionalities which can be very
useful to debug and verify which cookies are being sent and managed. This is crucial for
maintaining visibility into how cookies are influencing the behavior of your HTTP client
interactions.*/
